                Before we were colonized by the Spaniards, although the social
                systems were not perfect, not free from peasant oppression and
                slavery â€” land, at least in many parts of Luzon, was shared by
                everyone and was tilled for the whole community.
              </p>
              <p className="rice-card-modal-p">
                One well-known development is that there was already a
                prosperous irrigation system for their fields at that time. The
                famous rice terraces are worth mentioning, a product of the
                engineering genius of the early Ifugaos.
              </p>
              <p className="rice-card-modal-p">
                More so, pre-colonial Philippines had a great deal of
                achievements: livestock-raising, fishing, brewing, mining,
                lumbering, weapons and cannons, gunpowder, weaving,
                shipbuilding, and ornaments.
