        In little ways, we can support the Filipino peasant movement's struggle
        for national freedom and democracy. In the celebration of the Peasant
        Month this October, we can stand with them in their struggle for land,
        food, and justice, through amplifying their voices.
      </p>

      <p>
        Join us in honoring them through submitting any peasant-related artworks
        â€” illustrations, songs, videos, writings, among many other ones,
        carrying these calls:
